## Theory

### What are capacitors?

A capacitor is a device which stores energy, and we are going to use them to make a quick powerful electric discharge.

#### Why not use a battery instead of capacitors?

Because it takesa much longer time to get the same amount of energy from a battery. This is caused because the internal resistance of a battery is higher than a capacitor.

### How many capacitors may I use?

## Theory

### What is a capacitor?

A capacitor is a device which stores energy, and we are going to use them to make a quick powerful electric discharge.

The basic unit of capacitance is the farad, but this unit is quite huge, so for general use in electronics we are going to use microfarad (10-6 F).

#### Why not use a battery instead of capacitors?

Because it takesa much longer time to get the same amount of energy from a battery. This is caused because the internal resistance of a battery is higher than a capacitor.

### How many capacitors may I use?

You can use as many as you want but be aware that they can all be used at the same voltage.

### How should I connect them?

If you are using just one large capacitor you can avoid this section.
